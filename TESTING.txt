Tests performed:
1) Run 4 instances locally (9001â€“9004) with ./run_ring.sh 4 9001
2) Propagation: message from 9002 to 9004 traverses ring (seen on 9004)
3) Ordering: injector sends seq 2 then seq 1 from 9001 to 9003; 9003 shows seq 1 then seq 2
Automation:
- ./demo_test.sh performs both demos using the C++ SimpleInjector
